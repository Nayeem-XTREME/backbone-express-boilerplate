# backbone-express-boilerplate
 A Boilerplate for backbonejs with express. I wanted to keep it simple. So that, you can use your own favourite tools for deployment and testing. There is no grunt/gulp and test tool integration.
 I have used requirejs for loading the views and other modules. So you have to use requirejs optimizer to optimize/minify the js files. Please checkout the options here, [http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html]
